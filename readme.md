# CS 3333 Project
___

This is a project for my class, CS 3333 - Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

It's a project based on the concepts I learned about modular arithmetic, prime numbers, and GCD. Using C, I'm tasked with performing RSA encryption.
